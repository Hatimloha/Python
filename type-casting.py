#Type casting refers to converting a value from one data type to another. It's like changing the form of information to fit a different context.

1. Algorithm 
a="1"
b="5"
print(int(a) + int(b))

output: 
6


2. Algorithm
string = "10"
number = 15 
string_number = int(string)
sum = number + int(string) 
print("the sum of both number is:", sum)

Output: 
the sum of both number is: 25

#Implicity: when the programming language automatically converts one data type to another without any explicit instruction 
3.Algorithm
c = 9.1
b = 8
print(c + b)

Output: 
17.1 (output is in "float" datatype)
