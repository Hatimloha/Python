# The code you provided will not work because of a couple of reasons:

# Sets and Mutability: The variable s is defined as a set (s = {8, 7, 12, "harry", [1, 2]}), but sets in Python can only contain hashable (immutable) types. Lists, like [1, 2], are mutable and therefore cannot be included in a set. This will raise a TypeError.

# Indexing a Set: Even if the set were valid, sets in Python are unordered collections, meaning you cannot access elements by index (like s[4]). Trying to do so will raise a TypeError stating that 'set' object is not subscriptable.

# If you want to use a collection that allows indexing and includes mutable items, consider using a list or a tuple instead. Here's an example with a list:

s = {8,7,12, "harry", [1,2]}
s[4][0] = 9 # This will work, and the list will become [9, 2]
